# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to configure your local environment and run the application.

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

**Windows:**
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

##  2. Install Dependencies
Once the environment is active, install the required libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt


## 3. Run the Application
Launch the project by executing the main script located in the src folder.

python3 src/main.py
